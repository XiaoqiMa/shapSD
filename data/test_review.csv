thinking biggest issue among three topics far rebel it done way completely passive pretty much every violent threatening situation covered i dislike leading lady america i come the selection expecting find warrior but worst thing directly threatened another contestant ripping sleeve one comparisons the hunger games smart got talk and lot the selection lacked dystopian danger physical jeopardy main made somewhat twisted fairy tale type filled internal fascinating characters intriguing premise succeeded the love although i picked team easy set way sure danger quota the relationships america girls competing well america extremely well considering size fireballs i threw book minute allow grant praise of books i read last year none allowed recapture experience loss first love hopeful thrill

needed already together make plot really put character disadvantage made feel like plot device whereas actually get know america least i felt attachment growing also parallel things aspen get america go comparison maxom behaves every turn pretty much tells want does work is likely helped make character i assumed would but also poses as far the selection love triangle the fact i easy time picking

rules four pages illustrated pages the game printed many languages distinction first major game release i know produced something rather dear the game explained i pleased easy people pick even people hard time understanding simple games cannot attack people settlers easy time picking game i amazed fast strategies picked when i first taught game eric ceo days i think strategy would beat scoring points friends i i thought i realized several things i missed i found game different impressed one ignore ticket cards try place long hoping get lot or one try complete many ticket cards worrying much long trains place middle ground compromise two strategies enough not mention fact players must watch occasionally place trains mess this gives game real sometimes best move player place train cars cities care much stop another player either getting longest chain completing this cause good i really enjoyed player interaction taking cards placing holding fun get big hand cards upper players try hoard cards place long trains scoring big players must always keep mind everyone else watching trying determine the longer player keeps cards less tip one player suddenly uses causing final stuck huge hand quite my wife found hard she connect three cities would complete two tickets probably winning another friend either one could held cards one turn long of i evil guy caused game i got losing one point yet another player winning point caused longest continuous train fun and even little nasty game extremely the decisions causing game move quite stressful yet decisions really make game blocking someone else using pulling two locomotives draw finally connecting two cities adds wonderful time time the game runs decisions bog game i impressed well game found game much different both needed different i really enjoyed i think strong possibilities one best games alan moon always one favorite one best games days wonder put lot time effort producing when i first played i thought boring game
