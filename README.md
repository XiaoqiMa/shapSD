# shapSD

**shapSD** is a Python package that enables to inspect variable influence in black box models through pattern mining. It combines the interpretation methods and subgroup discovery technique. 

**Interpretation methods**
- Feature importance
    - The feature importance is measured by the increase in the prediction error of the model after permuting the feature values 
- shapley values
    - A method for assigning payouts to players depending on their contribution to the total payout (from coalition game theory) 



**Subgroup Discovery**

Subgroup Discovery is a well established data mining technique that allows you to identify patterns in your data.
The goal of subgroup discovery is to identify descriptions of data subsets that show an interesting distribution with respect to a pre-specified target concept.
